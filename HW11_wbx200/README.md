For both assignments, I followed the notebooks as laid out by Professor Bianco and worked with my group - 
Matt Sloane, Kelsey Reid, Marc Toneatto, and Ozgur Akkas.

For Assignment 2, we ran into quite a bit of difficulty and consulted with Scott Smith for a significant portion of the code. 
I relied extensively on his detailed code for combining the Census data in order to come up with the right format.

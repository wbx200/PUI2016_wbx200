The figure is really clear and easy to read. It has a resonable title, xy axsis lable, readable legend, and also clear caption that explains the figure. The scatter however, might be a little too big so they are overlap with each other a little bit. And the color used for scatter is a little hard to read for color blind patient especially Deuteranopia. 

Overall, this is a gread plot!

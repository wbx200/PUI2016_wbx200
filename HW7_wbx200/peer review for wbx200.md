<br><br><b><u>Figure 1.</u></b> This is a comparison of female to male median income, based on the 2014 Annual Social and Economic Supplement from the U.S. Census Bureau. The data points represent the female-male income pair for each demographic (All, Asian, Black, Hispanic, White). The dotted line represents the "Income Equality Line," at which females and males earn the same income. Based off of this line, we can see that female income is significantly below male income across the demographic spectrum.



##**CLARITY:** This plot is very clear to read, and especially from the caption it is clear what is being presented. I would suggest possibly including that this is annual data somewhere on the plot, and what years are being presented, and from what country or region, just so one doesn't have to look to the caption for this information. This would probably fit best in the title.

##**ESTHETIC:** It's fairly esthetically pleasing. Good use of readable fonts and contrast in colors. One suggestion would be to reduce the font size of the title and axis labels, and to pull them farther from the axis. Especially the title, since it covers some of the labels on the y-axis. This site has some good ideas for that: https://plot.ly/matplotlib/figure-labels/. You could also change the rotation of the axis labels, or put them in 1000s of dollars since they are somewhat long (especially along the x-axis). 

##**HONESTY:** Having equal income values on each axis, as well as the income equality line, were good ways to display this data in an honest way.
